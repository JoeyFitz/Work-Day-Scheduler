# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description
This repo contains source code for a simple work day scheduling web application designed to run locally in your browser. It was a homework assignment with some starter HTML and CSS code provided and designed to reinforce rudimentary employment of jquery. The actual behavior of the application meets the user acceptance criteria included below. In a nutshell, a user loads the application in their browser. The app uses moment.js to render the current date at the top of the application. The user is able to enter text into input fields for each hourly block of the work day. When the user hits the 'save' button to the right of the hourly block, the input value is saved to the browser's local storage. The user can edit the calendar event and overwrite the input value stored locally. Upon refreshing the page, the calendar events are loaded from local storage. There is also some conditional logic that changes the background color of the hourly blocks depending on the current time.

## User Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
